/// This class offers an easy way to create an angle from various form:
/// - from degrees;
/// - from radians;
/// - from degrees in the sexagesimal form (degrees, minutes, seconds);
class Angle {
  /// The angle value in degrees.
  late final double degrees;

  /// The angle value in radians.

  /// Creates an [Angle] from its sexagesimal form ([degrees], [minutes], [seconds]).

  /// In case of a negative angle, only the [degrees] value should be negative. If the [minutes] and/or [seconds] are negative,
  /// these will be converted into positive values to avoid confusion.

  /// So, an angle of ```-12Â° 32' 44"``` should be entered as:

  /// Angle(degrees: -12, minutes: 32, seconds: 44);
