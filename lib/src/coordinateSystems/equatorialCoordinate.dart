/// The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects.

/// The coordinates are defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of
/// Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox,
/// and a right-handed convention.
